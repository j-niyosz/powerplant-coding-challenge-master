***Power plant coding challenge***

To be able to use the code you need to :
    -import json
    -import sys
    -from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
in your main python file.

It is recommended to use the application Postman. Because is it more simple to use for the different methods
used by the API (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)
You can of course do it with the terminal directly on your IDE it is less intuitive.
You will also need to have the different payload file saved in the same directory as your python file
